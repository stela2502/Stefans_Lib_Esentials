This is a pain in the a...
I had to force this:


 export PERL_LOCAL_LIB_ROOT="/projects/fs1/common/software/StefansPerl/1.2.0/"
 export PERL_MB_OPT="--install_base "/projects/fs1/common/software/StefansPerl/1.2.0/""
 export PERL_MM_OPT="INSTALL_BASE=/projects/fs1/common/software/StefansPerl/1.2.0/"

But after that the installation went fine.
